# Wrangle and Analyze Data

Udacity Data Analyst Course - Project 03

## Introduction

This project was completed as a part of the **Udacity Data Analyst Course**/

The project consists of 3 primary stages;

- Data Gathering and Wrangling (wrangle_act.ipynb)
- Analyzing and Visualizing Data (wrangle_act.ipynb)
- Reporting:
  - wrangle_report.pdf
  - act_report.pdf

## Data Gathering and Wrangling

The intent of this project was to practice wrangling techniques using delimited files, pandas dataframes, APIs, and more.

One primary data source was a manually downloaded csv, a second was a manually downloaded tsv, and the third was accessing the twitter API itself using the python tweepy module.

Once all the data was gathered, it was 'cleaned' and merged into a master dataset stored locally.

Partially because this was all done in a single jupyter notebook, this was a fairly long and arduous process. It was a great learning opportunity, particularly in honing jupyter notebook organization and presentation skills.

## Analyzing and Visualization Data

In the analysis, I had the opportunity to practice using some OLS regression to determine correlations.

I was able to show that there was a demonstrable relationship between the ratings of dogs, which seemed fairly arbitrary, and the favorite/retweet counts.

I was able to learn some new techniques to generate some very entertaining visualizations; wordclouds and mosaics.

## Reporting

I took this opporunity to take a short course in LaTeX and employ my new knowledge on the generation of two reports:
    - wrangle_report.pdf
    - act_report.pdf

While outside of the scope of the rubric for this project, learning a bit and using LaTeX was a fulfilling exercise in itself.
